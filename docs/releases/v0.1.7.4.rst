What's new in Firenado 0.1.7.4
==============================

Dec 01, 2018
------------

We are pleased to announce the release of Firenado 0.1.7.4.

With launcher loading separately from the launch method we can use it to
retrieve applications in management tasks and tests.

Services will retrieve a data connected consumer when calling the get data
connected method.

Fixed an attempt to write a none session. This is happening when we have a
handler with error set by tornado. The error was noticed in a post method
without xsrf argument/cookie. The handler was set with a 403 and other
exception as raised because we were waiting for a valid session. Now a warning
will be logged regarding the issue of a none session in this case.

Here are the highlights:
