What's new in Firenado 0.2.8
============================

Mar 27, 2021
------------

We are pleased to announce the release of Firenado 0.2.8.

Removed six from the project directly. Some other packages(like croniter) may
depend on six but our logic is tied to python 3 at this point. It was also
removed `import from __future__` as python 2.7 support was removed.

The dynamic configuration is being handled by cartola.config and logging from
scheduler level was changed to debug instead of info.

As sqlalchemy was changed to 1.4.3 we added the future parameter to the data
source configuration to make it possible port application to the 2.0 style.

Here are the highlights:
