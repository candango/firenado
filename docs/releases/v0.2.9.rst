What's new in Firenado 0.2.9
============================

Apr 03, 2021
------------

We are pleased to announce the release of Firenado 0.2.9.

Logging basic configuration will be executed in the launcher instead of the
import of `firenado.conf`. This will make it easier to evolve logging
functionalities and fix some undesired behaviors caused by all logging logic
being handled in `firenado.conf`.

Here are the highlights:
